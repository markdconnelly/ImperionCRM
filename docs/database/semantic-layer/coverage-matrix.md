# Master coverage matrix

Every object in the system → its **owning domain** → **implementation archetype** →
whether it has an **IKF (OKF) concept file** yet → the **ICM workflow** that acts on it.
Archetypes and the loop are defined in
[data-and-automation-doctrine](../../architecture/data-and-automation-doctrine.md); the
domain tier is [ADR-0088](../../decision-records/ADR-0088-icm-self-hosted-managed-agents-runtime.md)
(epic [#695](https://github.com/markdconnelly/ImperionCRM/issues/695)).

**IKF status:** ✅ concept file exists · ⏳ planned (expansion, #536). **Authored
concepts** live in [`tables/`](tables/). The matrix is the whole picture; concept files
are added in batches.

**Archetype legend:** **A** multi-source merge silver · **B** single-source-of-record
silver · **C** append-only ledger + derived view · **D** write-back sidecar (idempotent
external write) · **E** golden/drift · **F** reconciliation view · **G** gold knowledge
object · **H** reference/config/identity.

**Domain legend (ADR-0088):** every entity has **exactly one** owning domain — the rule
that validates the carve (zero or two domains = a defect to resolve). Nine verticals:
**Marketing · Sales · Delivery · Service Desk · Customer Success · Finance · People ·
Knowledge · Security**. Two non-vertical markers: **kernel** — the shared customer record
referenced everywhere (`account`/`contact`/`employee`/`contract`); **horizontal** — an
inherited concern (governance/identity/observability/data-platform), owned by the
Constitution, not a vertical. Contested rows are the seams flagged at the end.

## Bronze source tables (raw, per-source — archetype inputs)

Bronze never gets its own concept file (it is raw, lossless input) and carries no domain
of its own — it inherits the domain of the silver entity it feeds.

| Feeds | Bronze tables |
|---|---|
| account / contact / device (A) | `{autotask,apollo,itglue,m365,website}_contacts` · `{autotask,apollo,itglue,website}_companies` · `{itglue,m365,website}_devices` · `datto_rmm_devices` · `datto_bcdr_backups` (backup-posture field merge, #683) |
| opportunity (A) | `kqm_opportunities` (+lines/+sections/+sales_orders) · `autotask_opportunities` · `website_opportunities` |
| contract / ticket (B) | `autotask_contracts` · `docusign_contracts` · `autotask_tickets` |
| time_record (A) | `website_time_entry` · `autotask_time_entry` |
| expense_item (A) | `website_expense_item` · `website_mileage` (manual, #851) · `mileiq_drive` · `qbo_purchases` (match) |
| invoice (B, QBO read-only mirror) | `qbo_invoices` (+ `qbo_customers` join; `qbo_payments` future match) |
| credential_exposure / assessment_artifact (A/B) | `darkwebid_exposures` · `televy_reports` |
| interaction (B) | `m365_mail_messages` · `m365_teams_chats/_meetings` · `facebook_posts/_comments/_messages` · `instagram_media/_comments` |
| posture / dns (C/E) | `secure_scores` · `defender_incidents/_alerts` · `entra_*` · `intune_*` · `*_golden` · `dns_zones` · `dns_records` · `sharepoint_sites` · `azure_*` · `sentinel_*` |
| social_metric (B) | `meta_insights` |

## Seams to resolve (the one-domain rule)

These rows are defensibly single-owned today but sit on a boundary; revisit as the domain
tier matures:

- **`device`** — Service Desk (CMDB authority) vs Security (asset context). Owned by Service
  Desk; Security reads it.
- **`time_record` / `timesheet`** — Finance (monthly-close authority) vs People (workforce).
  Owned by Finance; People reads attendance.
- **`contact_enrichment` / `contact_social_identity`** — kernel satellite vs Marketing demand.
  Kept on **kernel** as contact extensions; Marketing consumes.
- **`discovery_call` / `assessment*`** — Sales (qualification) vs Customer Success. Owned by
  Sales; CS consumes downstream.

Expansion of remaining ⏳ concepts is tracked in
[#536](https://github.com/markdconnelly/ImperionCRM/issues/536). The staleness CI gate
([#535](https://github.com/markdconnelly/ImperionCRM/issues/535)) is **live**: a PR
changing a silver table with a ✅ concept file must update that file in the same PR
(see [semantic-layer-gate](../../operations/semantic-layer-gate.md)). The domain column
feeds the **live** `icm-conformance` check ([#702](https://github.com/markdconnelly/ImperionCRM/issues/702)):
every ICM `okf_rooms` entry must resolve to a concept-bearing (✅) row here, else the
gate fails the PR (`scripts/agent-yaml-gate.mjs`; see
[agent-yaml-schema](../../agents/agent-yaml-schema.md)).
