# Master coverage matrix

Every object in the system → its **owning domain** → **implementation archetype** →
whether it has an **IKF (OKF) concept file** yet → the **ICM workflow** that acts on it.
Archetypes and the loop are defined in
[data-and-automation-doctrine](../../architecture/data-and-automation-doctrine.md); the
domain tier is [ADR-0088](../../decision-records/ADR-0088-icm-self-hosted-managed-agents-runtime.md)
(epic [#695](https://github.com/markdconnelly/ImperionCRM/issues/695)).

**IKF status:** ✅ concept file exists · ⏳ planned (expansion, #536). **Authored
concepts** live in [`tables/`](tables/). The matrix is the whole picture; concept files
are added in batches.

**Archetype legend:** **A** multi-source merge silver · **B** single-source-of-record
silver · **C** append-only ledger + derived view · **D** write-back sidecar (idempotent
external write) · **E** golden/drift · **F** reconciliation view · **G** gold knowledge
object · **H** reference/config/identity.

**Domain legend (ADR-0088):** every entity has **exactly one** owning domain — the rule
that validates the carve (zero or two domains = a defect to resolve). Nine verticals:
**Marketing · Sales · Delivery · Service Desk · Customer Success · Finance · People ·
Knowledge · Security**. Two non-vertical markers: **kernel** — the shared customer record
referenced everywhere (`account`/`contact`/`employee`/`contract`); **horizontal** — an
inherited concern (governance/identity/observability/data-platform), owned by the
Constitution, not a vertical. Contested rows are the seams flagged at the end.

**Data-class legend (ADR-0118, #1034):** the third access axis — data SENSITIVITY, the MSP's
real isolation axis (employees roam all clients; the gate is the class, not the client). Every
object carries exactly one **`data_class`**: **op** operational/CMDB (broad-read default) ·
**fin** financial (always-gate) · **hr** people_hr · **sec** security_credentials (always-gate) ·
**pii** client_pii (always-gate). The class is the THIRD RLS read-predicate and the action-plane
ceiling (one rule, both layers — `app_data_class_allowed()`, migration 0175). always-gate classes
(fin/sec/pii) are the hard ceiling earned autonomy can never auto-cross (#1036). The **Class**
column below is **fully populated** (#1210 backfill): every ✅ concept-bearing row's class is the
authority value carried in that concept file's `data_class` frontmatter; ⏳ / `n/a` rows are
classed here by the same content rule (the file inherits it when authored). A concept file's
`data_class` frontmatter remains the authority for its row.

## Bronze source tables (raw, per-source — archetype inputs)

Bronze never gets its own concept file (it is raw, lossless input) and carries no domain
or data_class of its own — it inherits both the **domain** and the **data_class** of the
silver entity it feeds (so e.g. the `qbo_*`/`website_expense_*` feeds are `fin`, the
`darkwebid`/`televy` feeds are `sec`, the M365 mail/Teams + social feeds are `pii`).

| Feeds | Bronze tables |
|---|---|
| account / contact / device (A) | `{autotask,apollo,itglue,m365,website}_contacts` · `{autotask,apollo,itglue,website}_companies` · `{itglue,m365,website}_devices` · `datto_rmm_devices` · `unifi_devices` (network infra: switches/APs/gateways + firmware compliance, #1053/0162; collector LP #73/#259, merge LP follow-up) · `datto_bcdr_backups` (backup-posture field merge, #683) · `intune_managed_apps` (device app-inventory drill, #261/0148) |
| cloud_asset (A) | `cloud_resources` (source `azure_arm`, 0130; Azure first, `aws_*`/`gcp_*` later) |
| software_ci (A) | `intune_managed_apps` (source `intune`, #261/0148; one silver install row per app on a device, device-resolved → account; #652/0204) |
| opportunity (A) | `kqm_opportunities` (+lines/+sections/+sales_orders) · `autotask_opportunities` · `website_opportunities` |
| contract / ticket (B) | `autotask_contracts` · `docusign_contracts` · `autotask_tickets` |
| time_record (A) | `website_time_entry` · `autotask_time_entry` |
| expense_item (A) | `website_expense_item` · `website_mileage` (manual, #851) · `mileiq_drive` · `qbo_purchases` (match) |
| invoice (B, QBO read-only mirror) | `qbo_invoices` (+ `qbo_customers` join; `qbo_payments` future match) |
| credential_exposure / assessment_artifact (A/B) | `darkwebid_exposures` · `televy_reports` |
| interaction (B) | `m365_mail_messages` · `m365_teams_chats/_meetings` · `facebook_posts/_comments/_messages` · `instagram_media/_comments/_messages` · `threads_posts/_replies/_mentions` (source `threads`, 0208/ADR-0125; our own Threads presence — posts/replies + public mentions of us) |
| client_communication (B) | `m365_mail_messages` · `m365_teams_chats/_meetings` (→ `account_domain` 0081 + onboarded `contact` filter) · **`facebook_messages` (0075, `meta_messenger`)** + **`instagram_messages` (0206, `instagram_dm`)** for `channel=social_dm` (→ `contact_social_identity` handle-link filter, **no domain path**; #1370/ADR-0124, see social-dm-foldin.md). Subject+snippet only, no bodies. Merge co-locates w/ ingestion (LP ADR-0026) — sibling follow-up |
| posture / dns (C/E) | `secure_scores` · `defender_incidents/_alerts` · `entra_*` · `intune_*` · `*_golden` · `dns_zones` · `dns_records` · `sharepoint_sites` · `azure_*` · `sentinel_*` |
| social_metric (B) | `meta_insights` · `threads_insights` (platform `threads`, 0208/ADR-0125) |
| social_engagement (B) | `facebook_comments` · `instagram_comments` (kind `comment`, slice H LP #357) · `meta_mentions` (kind `mention`, public FB Page / IG brand mentions of us; 0213/#1365). Poll-first (ADR-0124 #8), merge co-locates w/ ingestion (LP ADR-0026) — Threads mentions ride `interaction` instead (ADR-0125) |
| account (via `entity_xref`) + license_assignment (A) | `pax8_companies` · `pax8_subscriptions` · `pax8_licenses` · `pax8_orders` (0161; collector LP #279). Merge LP #280 resolves company→`account` into `entity_xref`; license facts → `license_assignment` (0185) |

## Seams to resolve (the one-domain rule)

These rows are defensibly single-owned today but sit on a boundary; revisit as the domain
tier matures:

- **`device`** — Service Desk (CMDB authority) vs Security (asset context). Owned by Service
  Desk; Security reads it.
- **`time_record` / `timesheet`** — Finance (monthly-close authority) vs People (workforce).
  Owned by Finance; People reads attendance.
- **`contact_enrichment` / `contact_social_identity`** — kernel satellite vs Marketing demand.
  Kept on **kernel** as contact extensions; Marketing consumes.
- **`discovery_call` / `assessment*`** — Sales (qualification) vs Customer Success. Owned by
  Sales; CS consumes downstream.

Expansion of remaining ⏳ concepts is tracked in
[#536](https://github.com/markdconnelly/ImperionCRM/issues/536). The staleness CI gate
([#535](https://github.com/markdconnelly/ImperionCRM/issues/535)) is **live**: a PR
changing a silver table with a ✅ concept file must update that file in the same PR
(see [semantic-layer-gate](../../operations/semantic-layer-gate.md)). The domain column
feeds the **live** `icm-conformance` check ([#702](https://github.com/markdconnelly/ImperionCRM/issues/702)):
every ICM `okf_rooms` entry must resolve to a concept-bearing (✅) row here, else the
gate fails the PR (`scripts/agent-yaml-gate.mjs`; see
[agent-yaml-schema](../../agents/agent-yaml-schema.md)).
